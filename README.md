## How to try these projects

If you feel like taking the time you can run all these projects by installing the Racket language which should come with the DrRacket IDE.

You can download the language and IDE [here](https://download.racket-lang.org/)

Once installed make sure to select the correct language in DrRacket.

1. Select the 'Language' dropdown in the top bar.
2. Click 'Choose Language'
3. Select 'Other Languages'
4. Select 'R5RS'
5. Click 'Ok'

Some of the simpler projects can be run by simply clicking 'Run' in the top panel of the IDE but to use some of the more complex programs requires use of the IDE command line. Instructions for running the projects can be found at the top of the source code in the comments.

I may add additional documents explaining each project and how to use them in a more concise way.
